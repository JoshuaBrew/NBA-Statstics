### NBA Player Usage% and Team Success Data Science Project

#### 1. Project Overview
   - **Objective**: Determine if a ball-dominant playstyle leads to greater team success, measured in SRS (Simple-Rating System) or relative strength of a team.
   - **Hypothesis**:  Teams with a higher usage rate for key players will have a higher positive correlation with their overall team success.
   - **Significance**: NBA teams across over have adapted different playstyles that are dependent on how an offense is coordinated through a primary ball handlers. In the modern age of basketball, there is a nuance of positionless-basketball. In this case, the primary facillator isn't always the point guard. This study investigates how key player impact and their usage rate affect overall team success.

#### 2. Data Collection
   - #### Data on indivudual players were sourced from www.basketball-refrence.com and www.nba.com/stats. Data on team success was sourced from an excel file (attached to repository).

### Key metrics:

- **PPG (Player points per game)
- **REB (Player rebounds per game)
- **AST (Player assists per game)
- **PPG+AST+REB (Player impact) 
- **USG% (Usage Rate, how often player is in control of the ball)
- **SRS (Simple-Rating System, relative strength of a team)
- **Average USG% (takes the average usage amongst the key players of a team)
- **Average PPG+AST+REB (takes the average PPG+AST+REB amongst the key players of a team)**


#### 3. Methods and Algorithms
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Mention any initial statistics or data summaries.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Describe techniques and tools used for exploring the data (e.g., visualization, correlation matrices).
   - **Statistical Testing**: Detail any statistical tests conducted to support or refute the hypothesis.
   - **Regression Analysis**: Explain the regression techniques used to analyze the relationship between player usage% and team success.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Discuss how models were validated and their performance metrics.

#### 4. Results
   - **Summary of Findings**: Provide a brief overview of key findings without going into too much detail.

#### 5. Discussion
